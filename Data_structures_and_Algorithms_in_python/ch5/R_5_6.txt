R-5.7 Let A be an array of size n ≥ 2 containing integers from 1 to n − 1, inclu-
    sive, with exactly one repeated. Describe a fast algorithm for ﬁnding the
    integer in A that is repeated.
"""

# Solution 1

1. Create empty array as B 
2. Make for loop for all items in array A
3. Test item is in B if not exist append it to array B
4. if exist that is meaning item repeated and return it

# solution 2

1. Make for loop for all items in array A.
2. using count method to calculate number of times repeate item
2. if item count greater than or equal 2 return item as repeated integer.
